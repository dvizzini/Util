Util
====

A kitchen sink to be used in multiple projects, kept in one place to avoid code drift.

The project consists of one package: com.danielvizzini.util. With the exception of Knapsack and KnapsackItem, all classes therein only contain static methods and cannot be instantiated.

The Knapsack class is an extention of arraylist that onld holds only itmems that implement the KnapsackItem interface and executes the knapsack algorithm to efficiently pack these items.

A jar of the latest code is added for convenience. You can link to the attached doc and src directories to sync your IDE with the javadocs and source files, respectively.
